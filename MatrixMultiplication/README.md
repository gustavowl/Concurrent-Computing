# ASSIGNMENT INFO

The purpose of the assignment was to show the students a simple example of how concurrent computing can run faster than sequential. Also, to show that by using more threads, the program will not necessarily run faster.

The activity was to simply implement two versions of a matrix multiplication algorithm: a single threaded and a multithreaded. A benchmark was also requisited.

Initially, the assignment should be implemented using either Java or C++. However, the professor let me develop it in Python. Although, I ended developing the same algorithm in C++ since the Python version was too slow to benchmarking for some cases.

All the matrices found at [matrices/](matrices/) were given by Professor [Everton](http://www.dimap.ufrn.br/~everton/?lang=en) so we could benchmark the algorithms.

## Beyond the scope
To quench a curiosity I have, I decided to keep working on this assignment. The idea is to benchmark the matrix multiplication (initially) for 3 languages: C++, Python (compiled and not compiled), and GO. I'm doing this so I can have a better knowledge regarding each language's speed and the best scenario in which I should use them.
